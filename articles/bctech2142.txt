We are testing AWS Comprehend. I performed a key phrase analysis of our LinkedIn posts. We have an output file. Now we need your help to visualize the data so that we can interpret it.I also have the original export file from LinkedIn. I want to answer this business question:For the LinkedIn posts that received the highest engagement, which keywords, phrases, and hashtags were most commonly used?

I want to match up Engagement Rate with key phrase analysis. The business question is this: For the LinkedIn posts that received the highest engagement, what were the most common keywords, phrases and hashtags used?

Beyond matching to Engagement Rate, please check if there is a way to also view the data according to Impressions and Likes.

Data Driven Dashboards which will give the summary of Most used words, keywords, Phrases and also Analysis of Posts as per their interaction with their audience.

One of the major problem was to match the output of AWS Comprehend data with the data of excel sheet to find out which posts received maximum interactions and make a dashboard out of it.

Working on the output.json file in code editor and comparing it to the Linked In data sheet to check the accuracy of the output file with each post.
