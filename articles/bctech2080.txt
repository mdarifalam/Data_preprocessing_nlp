The objective of the project was to create a simple and easy-to-use dashboard for the accounting firm Tech 4 Accountants to track their highest performers, target number of clients, current week sales, tickets, customer satisfaction, leads, conversion, company records, and finances.

Our client, Andrew Lassise, wanted a KPI dashboard for Tech 4 Accountants that would help them track their business performance easily. The dashboard needed to have various charts and tables that would display important KPIs in a visually appealing manner.

To achieve our clientâ€™s objectives, we used Google Data Studio and Google Sheets to create a visually appealing and easy-to-use KPI dashboard. We created various charts and tables that displayed the KPIs that our client wanted to track. We used Google Sheets to store the data and created visualizations using Data Studio.

We delivered a KPI dashboard for Tech 4 Accountants that included charts and tables for tracking the highest performers, target number of clients, current week sales, tickets, customer satisfaction, leads, conversion, company records, and finances.
