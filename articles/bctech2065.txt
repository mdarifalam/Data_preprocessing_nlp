Our main objective in this project was to help with setting up with given Broker API using MT4 and extracting historical data from it, and solving different tasks which are related to extracting important values from the data. And tasks assigned by the client were related to working around the data, i.e. formatting, connecting with the IG trade broker, automating the Python script and scheduling the script accordingly.

During the initial phase, we were assigned to set up an MT4 with given Broker API access to extract historical prices, which was delivered to the client. In the second phase, the client requested to implement Profit/Loss, Spread Direction and Time in Trade. There were minute tasks related to the R script, which was duly completed. In the third phase, the client was assigned a task related to distinguishing the tickers according to cluster types which he provided and implemented code to distinguish the sell and buy spread for the given STD. In the fourth phase, I implemented the logic (Profit/Loss – (1% of 1st Currency + 1% of 2nd Currency)) into the existing code and worked on retrieving Historical prices from another Broker API and retrieving Watchlist given attributes by the client. Automated the Python script to retrieve yesterday’s market price of the given list
