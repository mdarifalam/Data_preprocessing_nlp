We need to create a notebook with solutions to binary classification-related anomaly detection problems. We need to use machine learning and deep learning models which have greater than 90% accuracy.

We created a notebook for anomaly detection. We used 10 to 15 machine learning and deep learning models but onlyÂ  3 different types of auto encoder models that were giving greater than 90% accuracy. We trained all 3 models on one classification data which have anomalies and evaluated trained models on test data.

A notebook that has solutions for anomaly detection related classification problems and accuracy should be above 90%.
