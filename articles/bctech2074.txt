Using Graph Technology to Create Single Customer View.

Client:A leading retail firm in Newzealand

Companies face issue of having a Single customer under various rows with slightly different information in the same database. This causes unwanted duplication and inaccurate statistics. It also results in inaccurate ad targeting and financial loss.

We leverage graph technology to create a single customer view by using Complex cypher queriesÂ  and Graph Algorithms.

We have an Azure VM on which we have installed the Neo4j Database. Deployment architecture is a single Instance because of using the Community version of the software.
