Organizations often face challenges in managing and understanding their vast and complex databases. As data infrastructure evolves, new databases are introduced, and existing ones are modified, leading to a lack of comprehensive visibility into the entire data landscape. This lack of awareness poses several issues, including increased difficulty in ensuring data quality, security vulnerabilities, and inefficiencies in database administration.

To address these challenges, there is a need for a Database Discovery Tool using OpenAI, aimed at providing an automated and intelligent solution for discovering, cataloging, and understanding the various databases within an organization’s ecosystem.

Key Problems to Solve:

Develop an OpenAI-powered Database Discovery Tool that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning capabilities to automatically discover, catalog, and provide insights into the organization’s databases. The tool should be able to:

By addressing these challenges, the Database Discovery Tool using OpenAI aims to empower organizations with a holistic view of their data landscape, facilitating better management, security, and optimization of databases.

Step 1. Database Support

In this step we communicate with different types of databases, like SQL and Oracle. This means it can connect and retrieve information from a variety of database systems using Python, providing users with more flexibility and compatibility across various database environments.

Step 2. Data Extraction

In this step we are using python for our Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes this involves efficiently reading and extracting data from the connected databases. Python handled the data-related tasks, ensuring a robust and effective extraction process and save the result in csv files which in turn are converted to .db files for sqlite.

Step 3. Fine-Tuning

In this step fine-tuning mechanisms to optimize the performance and accuracy of data extraction processes. This Ensures the ETL tool finds data accurately and quickly.

Step 4. Integration with OpenAI

In this step we have utilized SQL Agent for communication with OpenAI, By communicating with OpenAI, the SQL agent get the ability to understand and respond in a more intelligent and context-aware manner.

Step 5. API Integration

In this step we made Django API endpoints for requesting and receiving data. This means that external systems or applications can interact with the SQL Agent through OpenAI by sending requests and receiving responses through these APIs.

Step 6. Streamlit Frontend

In this step we made a streamlit frontend to chat with the SQL Agent. The user can ask question about the database and receive responses in form of insights.
