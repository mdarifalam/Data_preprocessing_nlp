Main challenge in this project extracting text from images and pdfs and generate json output according to template

In the apis we can upload .pdf, .docx, .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .txt files. It has basically 2 parts. We can just upload the document or we can also provide template id to process the uploaded document according to the template id.

It fetches the template and document from the database and uses the ocr method to extract the text from the document. This extracted text and template are then processed by gpt api which generates the final output..

This will help users to directly upload any pdf or image and extract useful information in json format.
