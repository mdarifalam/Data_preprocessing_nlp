To extract various Reports from the given input files. Reports to be extracted are: PRODUCTION COST – ANNUAL BY UNITS REPORT, SYSTEM EMISSIONS ANNUAL REPORT, RPS CONSTRAINT – ANNUAL REPORT, RELIABILITY – ANNUAL REPORT, RESERVE – ANNUAL REPORT and CAPACITY TOTALS ANNUAL REPORT. We had to extract above mentioned reports from the given .out files and store it in the respective .csv files.

We were given a bunch of .out files in which various Reports were available in table format. We need to extract some of the required reports from the given files and store them in their respective .csv files. A tool had to be developed in python in order to accomplish this task.

From each .out file its content extracted and stored in a list. Using regular expression, we searched the required report in the content. Another regular expression is used to mark as end of the table content. Content between the two given regular expressions is stored in a dataframe which is then stored into respective .csv file.
